# CLI based dictionary

Please check the [issue](https://github.com/DyckGerman/c-dictionary/issues/1) first 

### File format
The '§' symbol separates the word and its definition. `\n` symbol separates the words. No `\n` symbols are allowed inside the word or definition (sorry).
```sh
word§definition\n
new word§new definition\n
```

### CLI
Tryes to be friendly

### Missing parts (sorry, the budget is over)
 - Unit tests
 - Index for faster words searching
